                <h1>About No Cookie Banner</h1>
                <p>This small project was created when I was browsing through the blog posts on GitHub, and I came across the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/" target="_blank">No Cookie For You</a> post. During the same time, I was applying for a software engineer position at GitHub and I wanted a way to stand out.</p>
                <p>Now, the job description for the position I was interested in, mentioned experience with Ruby, C#, JavaScript, dotnet core, Go or an equivalent language as a qualification.</p>
                <p>Well, I knew my resume and work experience already showed I have experience with C#, .Net and JavaScript -- however, like I said, I wanted to stand out. So, I decided I'd learn Golang by building a small project.</p>
                <p>There was only one problem... what project should I build?</p>
                <p>Well, I started thinking, and decided that if I'm going to apply to this position at GitHub, why not build something around their content or a real problem they had?</p>
                <p>I read through the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/" target="_blank">No Cookie For You</a> article a few more times and finally, I had a revelation!</p>
                <p>I decided I was going to build a small web app that will tell someone whether or not they need a cookie banner.</p>
                <p>In a time span of around 8 hours, spread out over two days, No Cookie Banner was born.</p>
                <p>If you read this far, I want to thank you for reading the story behind No Cookie Banner and I hope one day soon, we can live in a world where we have a lot more cookies and a lot less cookie banners.</p>
